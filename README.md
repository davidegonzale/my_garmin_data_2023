# My Garmin data 2023 

2023 analysis of my Garmin watch data

## Data Source

The data used for this project is my own data recorded from my Garmin watch that is uploaded to the Garmin cloud (Garmin connect). Users are allowed to download reports of their training logs for up to 1 year of data; for this specific case, the data is for the year of 2023.

Instructions for downloading the data from Garmin Connect are available on the Garmin website:

Inside Garmin Connect under “All Activities” the reports exported for this task as CSV files are the following:

- Activities
- Activity Calories
- Average Heart Rate
- Max Heart Rate
- Total Activity Time
- Total Distance
- VO2 Max

Raw CSV files can be found in this repo, inside the folder `garmin_files`.
